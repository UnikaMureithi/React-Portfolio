          During my time at Strathmore University, I have maintained a high average grade of 74% and I am
          on track for first class honors once I graduate. I was also included in the Deanâ€™s list after
          completing my first, second and third years. Additionally, I have completed school projects and
          assignments that have helped me develop my programming and web design skills.
