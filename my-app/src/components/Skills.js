            <strong>WEB DEVELOPMENT:</strong> I have been able to develop a few
            web applications in some university projects. These websites were
            developed mainly using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

            <strong>PYTHON:</strong> I undertook a project that was developed
            using the Rapid Application Development Methodology (RAD). This app
            enabled users to provide input data in a form, where they could
            then receive a prediction of their susceptibility/likelihood of
            having cardiovascular disease. The tools used were Python, Django
            framework, Jupyter Notebook, CSS and HTML.

            <strong>FRAMEWORKS:</strong> Laravel, CodeIgniter and Django are
            frameworks that I am familiar with using, and they provide a
            structured and predefined way of organizing code.

            <strong>CHART JS:</strong> It is a helpful JavaScript library that
            enables me to create interactive and visually appealing charts and
            graphs on web pages, which is further used for data visualization.
